# Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the "applestore.csv" data set. By digging into download and rating data for software in the App Store, I hope to find the following information: What are the main categories of free and paid apps in the App Store? Price distribution of paid apps Is there a correlation between app size, price, and user ratings?
